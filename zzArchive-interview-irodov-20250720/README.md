   - Automatic Rust code generation from high-level specifications
   - Focus: "Describe, Don't Code" philosophy

2. **Flow (Sequence Language)**
   - Verb-based programming for backend operations
   - Natural language-like syntax for business logic
   - Focus: Extremely low cognitive load for developers

3. **Fuse (Visual Component System)**
   - Hybrid textual-visual programming environment
   - Component-based backend development
   - Focus: Visual debugging and system composition

#### Zenith Blueprint Language (ZBL)
- **Domain-Specific Language**: Exclusively for backend services
- **Mistake-Proof Design**: Language-level prevention of common errors
- **Rust Compilation**: Transpiles to idiomatic, high-performance Rust code

**Interview Applications**:
- **System Design**: Discuss trade-offs between different backend architectures
- **Language Design**: Demonstrate understanding of compiler design and DSLs
- **Performance Engineering**: Analyze memory safety and performance characteristics
- **Innovation Thinking**: Show ability to envision next-generation development tools

### RustCrashCourse202507.ipynb - Systems Programming Mastery
