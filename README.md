## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Interview Preparation
1. **Browse Question Categories**: Start with `Unclassified20250706.txt` for mixed practice
2. **Technology Deep Dives**: Use archived notebooks for specific framework preparation
3. **System Design**: Review `RailsViaRust20250707.txt` for architecture concepts
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Check `i00-pattern-list.txt` for common interview patterns

### For Rust Development Practice
1. **Build the TypeScript Compressor**:
   ```bash
   cd ts-compressor
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Test with Sample Files**:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/ts-compressor test-input/example.ts
   ```

## 🎓 Learning Pathways

### Backend Engineering Focus
- **Junior Level (0-2 years)**: Basic concepts, simple algorithms from archived notebooks
- **Mid-Level (2-5 years)**: System design basics, optimization patterns from text files
- **Senior Level (5+ years)**: Complex systems, trade-offs, leadership scenarios

### Technology Stacks Covered
- **Rust**: Systems programming, memory safety, performance optimization
- **Rails**: Web framework patterns, MVC architecture, rapid development
- **Python/FastAPI**: Modern API development, async programming
- **Go**: Concurrency patterns, microservices architecture
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: Full-stack development, event-driven programming

## 🛠 Tools and Utilities

### TypeScript Compressor (`ts-compressor/`)
A production-ready Rust tool for:
- TypeScript to JavaScript compilation
- Code minification and optimization
- Git-aware file processing
- Performance benchmarking

Perfect for demonstrating:
- Rust systems programming skills
- File processing and CLI tool development
- Performance optimization techniques
- Real-world tooling experience

## 📚 Study Session Workflow

### Daily Preparation Routine
1. **Morning Review**: Quick scan of question headers using grep
   ```bash
   grep -r "Q:" *.txt *.md
   ```

2. **Technology Focus**: Deep dive into specific framework files
3. **Hands-on Practice**: Use Jupyter notebooks for coding exercises
4. **Mock Interviews**: Mixed question practice from unclassified materials

### Advanced Study Techniques
- **Cross-Reference Learning**: Link concepts across different technology files
- **Real-World Application**: Use the Rust compressor tool to understand systems programming
- **Performance Analysis**: Study optimization patterns in both theory and practice

## 🎯 Interview Preparation Strategy
