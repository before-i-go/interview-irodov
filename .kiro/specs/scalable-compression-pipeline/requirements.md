# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Universal Code Compressor is a monolithic bottleneck that blocks the entire process and provides no user feedback. This specification focuses on three core improvements: adding a simple database for pattern persistence, implementing basic progress tracking, and making the compression pipeline non-blocking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Simple Pattern Database

**User Story:** As a developer compressing code, I want pattern analysis to persist to a local database, so that the process can resume if interrupted and I don't lose analysis work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes patterns THEN it SHALL store them in a local SQLite database
2. WHEN compression is interrupted THEN the system SHALL resume from the last saved state
3. WHEN patterns are found THEN they SHALL be stored with frequency counts and metadata
4. WHEN the database is corrupted THEN the system SHALL recreate it and continue

### Requirement 2: Progress Feedback

**User Story:** As a user running compression, I want to see what file is being processed and overall progress, so that I know the system isn't frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compression runs THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar with percentage
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL display the current file name
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL show basic statistics (files processed, patterns found)
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display the error and continue with other files

### Requirement 3: High-Performance Parallel Pipeline

**User Story:** As a user with large codebases, I want compression to maximize CPU utilization using the existing parallel processing infrastructure, so that compression completes as fast as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL use rayon parallel iterators to process files across all CPU cores
2. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL split content into chunks and process them concurrently
3. WHEN merging pattern results THEN the system SHALL use DashMap for lock-free concurrent updates
4. WHEN coordinating work THEN the system SHALL use crossbeam channels for efficient thread communication
5. WHEN writing to database THEN the system SHALL batch operations and use a connection pool
6. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL use memory mapping (memmap2) for large files

### Requirement 4: Basic Logging

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want simple log output with timing information, so that I can identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL log major steps with timestamps
2. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show detailed timing for each phase
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error with context
4. WHEN compression completes THEN the system SHALL log final statistics
