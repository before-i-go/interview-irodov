# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive interview preparation system for backend engineering roles. The system will organize technical questions, coding practice, and study materials in a structured format that supports effective learning and quick review sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Question Organization System

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to organize technical questions by topic and difficulty level, so that I can focus my study sessions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new question THEN the system SHALL categorize it by technology (Rails, Rust, Go, Python, etc.)
2. WHEN I review questions THEN the system SHALL display difficulty levels (Junior, Mid-level, Senior)
3. WHEN I search for topics THEN the system SHALL return all related questions across files
4. IF a question spans multiple technologies THEN the system SHALL cross-reference it appropriately

### Requirement 2: Study Session Management

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to track my study progress and identify knowledge gaps, so that I can optimize my preparation time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a study session THEN the system SHALL record which topics were covered
2. WHEN I encounter a difficult question THEN the system SHALL flag it for additional review
3. WHEN I prepare for an interview THEN the system SHALL suggest questions based on the target role
4. IF I haven't reviewed a topic recently THEN the system SHALL prioritize it in recommendations

### Requirement 3: Interactive Coding Practice

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to practice coding problems in an interactive environment, so that I can simulate real interview conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a coding question THEN the system SHALL provide a Jupyter notebook environment
2. WHEN I solve a problem THEN the system SHALL allow me to test multiple solutions
3. WHEN I review solutions THEN the system SHALL show time/space complexity analysis
4. IF a problem has multiple approaches THEN the system SHALL document trade-offs

### Requirement 4: System Design Question Bank

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to practice system design questions with detailed scenarios, so that I can prepare for architecture discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I study system design THEN the system SHALL provide realistic scenarios
2. WHEN I work through a design THEN the system SHALL include scalability considerations
3. WHEN I review solutions THEN the system SHALL show multiple valid approaches
4. IF a design involves specific technologies THEN the system SHALL link to relevant technical questions

### Requirement 5: Company-Specific Preparation

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to organize questions by company and role type, so that I can tailor my preparation to specific opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I prepare for a specific company THEN the system SHALL filter relevant questions
2. WHEN I add interview feedback THEN the system SHALL categorize it by company
3. WHEN I review company patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight common question types
4. IF I have multiple interviews THEN the system SHALL track preparation for each

### Requirement 6: Quick Reference and Search

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to quickly find specific concepts or questions during study sessions, so that I can efficiently use my preparation time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a concept THEN the system SHALL return results across all files
2. WHEN I need quick reference THEN the system SHALL provide concise summaries
3. WHEN I review related topics THEN the system SHALL show cross-references
4. IF I'm looking for examples THEN the system SHALL provide code snippets and explanations
