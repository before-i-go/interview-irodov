# Interview Prep System Design

## Overview

The interview preparation system is designed as a file-based knowledge management system that leverages existing tools (Jupyter notebooks, text files, grep) while providing structured organization for technical interview preparation. The system emphasizes quick access, searchability, and progressive learning.

## Architecture

### File-Based Storage Architecture

### Question Format Standard

Each question follows a consistent markdown structure:

```markdown
## Q: [Question Title] [Difficulty: Junior/Mid/Senior]

**Tags:** #rails #database #performance
**Companies:** Google, Meta, Netflix
**Last Reviewed:** 2025-01-15

### Question
What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking in Rails?

### Answer
[Detailed explanation with code examples]

### Follow-up Questions
- How would you implement optimistic locking?
- When would you choose one over the other?

### Related Topics
- Database transactions
- Race conditions
- ActiveRecord callbacks
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Question Management Component

**Purpose:** Organize and categorize interview questions
**Interface:** Markdown files with standardized headers

**Key Features:**
- Consistent question format across all files
- Tag-based categorization system
- Difficulty level classification
- Company-specific question tracking

### 2. Search and Discovery Component

**Purpose:** Enable quick finding of relevant questions and concepts
**Interface:** Command-line tools and scripts

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Search by technology
./search.sh --tech rails --difficulty senior

# Search by concept
./search.sh --concept "database optimization"

# Search by company
./search.sh --company google
```

### 3. Practice Environment Component

**Purpose:** Provide interactive coding practice
**Interface:** Jupyter notebooks with pre-configured environments

**Features:**
- Language-specific kernels (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Pre-loaded common libraries
- Test case frameworks
- Performance measurement tools

### 4. Progress Tracking Component

**Purpose:** Monitor study progress and identify gaps
**Interface:** Markdown-based logging system

**Data Structure:**
```markdown
# Study Session: 2025-01-15

## Topics Covered
- Rails ActiveRecord optimization
- Database indexing strategies
- N+1 query problems

## Questions Practiced
- [x] Rails eager loading vs includes
- [x] Database index types
- [ ] Query optimization techniques (needs review)

## Next Session Focus
- System design: caching strategies
- Rust memory management
```

### 5. Quick Reference Component

**Purpose:** Provide rapid access to key concepts
**Interface:** Structured reference documents

**Organization:**
- Technology-specific cheat sheets
- Algorithm complexity references
- System design pattern summaries
- Common interview question patterns

## Data Models

### Question Model
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  difficulty: 'Junior' | 'Mid' | 'Senior';
  tags: string[];
  companies: string[];
  category: string;
  question: string;
  answer: string;
  followUpQuestions: string[];
  relatedTopics: string[];
  lastReviewed: Date;
  reviewCount: number;
}
```

### Study Session Model
```typescript
interface StudySession {
  date: Date;
  topicsCovered: string[];
  questionsPracticed: string[];
  difficultQuestions: string[];
  nextSessionFocus: string[];
  duration: number;
  notes: string;
}
```

### Progress Tracking Model
```typescript
interface Progress {
  totalQuestions: number;
  questionsReviewed: number;
  weakAreas: string[];
  strongAreas: string[];
  upcomingInterviews: Interview[];
  studyStreak: number;
}
```

## Error Handling

### File System Errors
- **Missing Files:** Graceful degradation with helpful error messages
- **Corrupted Format:** Validation scripts to check question format consistency
- **Search Failures:** Fallback to basic grep when advanced search fails

### Content Validation
- **Question Format:** Automated checks for required fields
- **Tag Consistency:** Validation of tag naming conventions
- **Cross-References:** Verification of related topic links

### User Experience Errors
- **Search No Results:** Suggestions for alternative search terms
- **Notebook Failures:** Clear instructions for environment setup
- **Progress Tracking:** Backup and recovery for study logs

## Testing Strategy

### Content Testing
- **Question Format Validation:** Automated scripts to verify markdown structure
- **Link Checking:** Verify all cross-references and related topics
- **Tag Consistency:** Ensure consistent tagging across files

### Search Testing
- **Query Accuracy:** Test search results for relevance
- **Performance:** Measure search speed across large question sets
- **Edge Cases:** Handle special characters and complex queries

### Integration Testing
- **Jupyter Environment:** Verify notebook execution across different kernels
- **File Operations:** Test file creation, modification, and deletion
- **Cross-Platform:** Ensure compatibility across different operating systems

### User Workflow Testing
- **Study Session Flow:** End-to-end testing of typical study workflows
- **Progress Tracking:** Verify accurate logging and progress calculation
- **Quick Reference:** Test rapid access to key concepts during mock interviews
