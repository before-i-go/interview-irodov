# Interview Prep Technology Focus

## Core Technologies for Backend Interviews

### Programming Languages
- **Python**: Most common for coding interviews, system design discussions
- **Go**: Popular for backend roles, concurrency questions
- **Rust**: Systems programming, memory safety concepts
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Full-stack roles, async programming
- **Java**: Enterprise backend, OOP design patterns
- **Ruby**: Rails ecosystem, web development concepts

### Key Frameworks & Tools
- **Web Frameworks**: Rails, Django, Express, FastAPI, Gin
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS
- **Caching**: Redis, Memcached, CDN concepts
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure services

## Interview Question Categories

### Coding & Algorithms
- Data structures (arrays, trees, graphs, hash tables)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Backend-specific problems (rate limiting, caching strategies)

### System Design
- Scalability patterns (load balancing, sharding, replication)
- Microservices vs monolith architecture
- Database design and optimization
- Caching strategies and cache invalidation
- Message queues and event-driven architecture

### Technology Deep Dives
- Database internals (ACID, CAP theorem, indexing)
- Web protocols (HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC)
- Security (authentication, authorization, OWASP top 10)
- Performance optimization and monitoring

## Study Commands

### Search Interview Questions
```bash
# Find questions by topic
grep -r "What is" *.txt *.md
grep -r "How do you" *.txt *.md
grep -r "Explain" *.txt *.md

# Search by technology
grep -ri "redis" *.txt *.md
grep -ri "database" *.txt *.md
grep -ri "microservice" *.txt *.md
```

### Practice Sessions
```bash
# Start Jupyter for coding practice
jupyter notebook

# Review specific topic notes
cat RailsViaRust20250707.txt | grep -A 5 -B 5 "keyword"
```

## Interview Preparation Framework

### Question Types to Master
1. **Behavioral**: "Tell me about a time when..."
2. **Technical Concepts**: "What is the difference between..."
3. **System Design**: "How would you design..."
4. **Coding**: "Implement a function that..."
5. **Troubleshooting**: "How would you debug..."

### Difficulty Progression
- **Junior (0-2 years)**: Basic concepts, simple algorithms
- **Mid-level (2-5 years)**: System design basics, optimization
- **Senior (5+ years)**: Complex systems, trade-offs, leadership
